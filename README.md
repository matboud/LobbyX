./run-docker.sh
```

```

- 🏃 run th project:
```bash:

API Endpoints
The back end provides several API endpoints for interacting with the games database. For details on available endpoints and their usage, please refer to the API documentation section.


## PS:
- I haven't included environment variables for the backend or frontend in the project, even though they should be there. This is because I hosted the database on a VPS, and I didn't have enough time to configure it for proper communication.
